# 1768 - Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        # Get lengths
        w1_len = len(word1)
        w2_len = len(word2)
        acc = []  # can join at the end


        # Determine which is longer
        if w1_len > w2_len:
            short = w2_len
            remainder = word1[short:]
        else:
            short = w1_len
            remainder = word2[short:]

        # iterate through indices of the strings, accumulating
        for i in range(short):
            acc.append(word1[i])
            acc.append(word2[i])
        
        # add remainder to the end of the accumulator
        return "".join(acc) + remainder

        # Time complexity: O(n)
        #
	# n -> length of the shorter string
	#
        # If statement: O(1)
        # Loop: O(n)
        # Join: O(n)
        # Nothing is nested so we add (combinatorics) -> O(n)

        # Space complexity:
        #
	# m -> difference between longer string and shorter string
        # n -> length of shorter string
        #
        # length vars: O(1)
        # accumulator: O(n)
        # remainder: O(m)
        # We use both so O(m + n)
