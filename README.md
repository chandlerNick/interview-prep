1. Read + Clarify
2. Brainstorm - map to known pattern - after 20 mins
3. Reverse engineer - look at best solution --> study it!

5. Review - analyze time and space complexity

Write a short text answering the following:

- Name/number of the problem?
- Problem statement?
- What is the time complexity? How?
- What is the space complexity? How?
- What is the "pattern"?
- What is your solution (code/comments)?
