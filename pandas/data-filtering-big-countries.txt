# 595. Big Countries


# My soln:

import pandas as pd

def big_countries(world: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return world.loc[(world.area >= 3000000) + (world.population >= 25000000), ["name", "population", "area"]]


# Notes:

for booleans
+ -> or
* -> and 


also just | is or.

Ensure to use parantheses liberally. After it works, you can tersen it.
